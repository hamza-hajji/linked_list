** Linked List **

run `ruby test_drive.rb` to see an example of usage

_** Methods **_
* Create a new instance with `LinkedList.new`
* Add elements either to the beginning of the list `#prepend` or the end via `#append`
* See what the first and last nodes are via respectively `#head` and `#tail`
* Check for existence of a node's value via `#contains? value`
* See what's at a specific index with `#at index`
* See what index an element is located at via `#find value`
* Determine the size with the `#size` method
* If you print an instance of a list you get a nice output `(val1)->(val2)->...->(nil)`
* Delete the last node via `#pop`
